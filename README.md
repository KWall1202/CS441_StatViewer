This is an app that displays the rankings of Rocket League teams either globally or regionally. The top left button on any screen opens up a menu where the other tabs can be accessed. The global rankings tab displays the world's 35 best Rocket League teams. The regional rankings tab allows the user to veiw the top teams in a singular region. By using checkboxes on the home screen, the user is also able to filter by multiple regions at once.
